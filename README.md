# Tailwind CSS Configuration and Usage Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet often-unnoticed bug in Tailwind CSS setups. The issue arises from inconsistencies between the Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) and how Tailwind directives are used within the project's components.

## Problem

The primary symptom is missing styles or unpredictable styling behavior.  This occurs when Tailwind is unable to correctly process your styles due to misconfigurations or incorrect usage.  Examples include:

* Incorrect paths defined in `tailwind.config.js` within the `content` array leading to Tailwind not detecting your components.
* Missing or incorrectly placed `@tailwind` directives in your CSS file, preventing Tailwind from generating the necessary styles.
* Incorrect import statements or lack of proper integration with frameworks such as React, Vue, or Svelte.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to correctly configure and use Tailwind CSS, addressing the potential causes of this problem:

* Verify that all paths listed in `tailwind.config.js` are accurate and point to files containing Tailwind CSS class names.
* Ensure that appropriate `@tailwind` directives are included in your CSS file(e.g. `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`).
* Double-check the integration of Tailwind with your chosen framework following the official Tailwind CSS documentation.
