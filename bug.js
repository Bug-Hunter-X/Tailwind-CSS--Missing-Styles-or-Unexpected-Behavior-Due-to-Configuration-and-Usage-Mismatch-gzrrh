This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Vue.js or React.js. The error usually arises due to a mismatch between the Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`) and how you're importing or using the Tailwind directives in your component files.  For example, you might have a typo in your `content` array, or you might be missing `@tailwind` directives in your CSS file which are essential for Tailwind to process your styles.
