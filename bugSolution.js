The solution involves carefully reviewing your `tailwind.config.js` file to ensure that the `content` array correctly points to all files containing Tailwind classes.  Also, ensure you have the correct `@tailwind` directives in your main CSS file. Below is an example:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    './src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}', // Ensure this path is correct
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

```javascript
// main.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Verify that you have correctly imported and used the Tailwind classes in your component files according to your chosen framework's documentation.  If using a framework, carefully review its documentation for any specific setup instructions for using Tailwind.  For example, in React, you may need to use the `className` attribute, while in Vue.js, it might be `class`.
